# Cassandra-Project

This Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree project entails the creation of an Apache Cassandra database named sparkifyks tailored for Sparkify, a music app. 

## The primary objective of this NoSQL database is to facilitate queries related to song play data. The data model is structured to accommodate the following queries:

### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
   Faithless Music Matters (Mark Knight Dub) 495.30731201171875
### 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
